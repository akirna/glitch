I found a Chrome extension, Allow Right Click, which solves the first problem, but what about the text selection? Does anyone know if there is an extension available?  google-chrome selection browser-addons shareimprove this question asked Jun 30 \'10 at 0:01  DisgruntledGoat 1,56062439 add a comment 5 Answers activeoldestvotes up vote 3 down vote accepted No script is built into Chrome:  Options>Under the Hood tab>Content settings>JavaScript tab-Tick "do not allow any site to run javascript.  If you need to enable it on a site, either add the site to the exceptions list, or visit the site, then click the javascript icon in the address bar and select "always allow JS on www.xxxx", this will add it to the exceptions list, then refresh the webpage to allow JS to run.  EDIT:  Now it is 2015 and blocking javascript just cripples or breaks most websites so what I do now is i just do a "view page source" in Chrome and copy text from there, a bit harder but at least i can get it.  shareimprove this answer edited Jul 7 at 16:54  answered Jun 30 \'10 at 2:08  Moab 40.7k558108 2 \xa0  Ah yes, very useful. I basically did the opposite of what you suggested - blacklisted sites instead of whitelisting them. The only problem will be if a site has other useful javascript in addition to the click/select annoyances. –\xa0DisgruntledGoat Jun 30 \'10 at 11:07 1 \xa0  This might\'ve made sense in 2010, but it pretty much breaks the web of 2015. –\xa0Michael Scheper Jul 7 at 16:26 add a comment']['r Design 0.0.1']
