Running instructions:

For the server-
The server is currently hard coded to run on brki164-lnx-19. So, do the following:
ssh brki164-lnx-19
cd in to our team's folder
python httpserver.py
The server should now be running.

For the extension-
go to chrome://extensions
Reload the extension entitled "Senior Design"

To test-
Click on the extension icon in the upper right of the browser window (blue box).
In the pop up, type in a file name in the text box and press submit.
A pop up window should appear with the file name you entered. That popup comes from the following line of code:
window.alert(fileName);
so it is displaying the current state of the fileName variable.
Now, to send text to the server, highlight a line of text, right click, and select the Write To Server option.
You should see in your terminal window where the server is running that the server has received a POST. However, the key-value pair, which should be the file name and the selected text, is showing up as undefined and the selected text. This is where our problem lies.
We make the POST in the onClickHandler function, in the line:
xhr.send(fileName+"="+sText);
where fileName is the global variable we discussed and sText is the text the user selected.
