Running instructions:

For the server-
The server is currently hard coded to run on brki164-lnx-10. So, do the following:
ssh brki164-lnx-10
cd in to this folder
python httpserver.py
The server should now be running.
You can move the server to wherever you want. If you have it on your home directory, you will be able to use the extension with all of your files.
If you want to change the linux machine that the server is running on for whatever reason, change the host name and port global variables in glitchserver.py, popup.js, and background.js, and then ssh in to that machine instead.

For the extension-
Go to chrome://extensions
Check the box marked Developer mode if you have not already
Go to "Load Unpacked Extensions"
Choose the folder called Glitch
The extension should now be up and running.
